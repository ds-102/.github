# Data 102

UC Berkeley Data 102 develops the probabilistic foundations of inference in data science, and builds a comprehensive view of the modeling and decision-making 
life cycle in data science including its human, social, and ethical implications. Topics include: frequentist and Bayesian decision-making, permutation 
testing, false discovery rate, probabilistic interpretations of models, Bayesian hierarchical models, basics of experimental design, confidence intervals, 
causal inference, Thompson sampling, optimal control, Q-learning, differential privacy, clustering algorithms, recommendation systems and an introduction 
to machine learning tools including decision trees, neural networks and ensemble methods.
